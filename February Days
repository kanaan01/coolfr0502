/*Mona was born on 29 February. Every year she got confused about her birthday party since she can’t calculate whether this year is a leap year (سنة كبيسة) or not and thus can she make a birthday party or not?

The month of February normally has 28 days. But if it is a leap year, February has 29 days.
Write a program that helps Mona to decide if a given year is a leap year or not.

Use the following criteria to identify leap years:
1. Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if it is also divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year, but 2100 is not.
2. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 4. For example, 2008 is a leap year, but 2009 is not.*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void)
{
  int a;
  cin >> a;
  if(a%100==0 && a%400==0)
    cout << "Happy birthday,  February in " << a << " has 29 days.";
  else if(a%100!=0 && a%4==0)
      cout << "Happy birthday,  February in " << a << " has 29 days.";
  else 
    cout << "Unfortunately, February in " << a << " has 28 days.";
}
