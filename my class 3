 Challenge task
Write the definition of a struct MealNode with 2 member variables (Name and price) and the definition and implementation of the class Restaurant that has two member variables (an array of type MealNode and a length variable) as shown in the following UML diagrams.

Restaurant

 - meal[5]: MealNode

 - length: int

 + Restaurant()

 + insert(string, double): void

 + PrintAllMeals(): void

 + CountAllLessThan(double): int

 + riseOfprices(double): void

 +~Restaurant()

 

MealNode

+ Name: string

+ price: double

 

 

 

 












 

The constructor: will initialize the length to no meal in the list.
 
insert(string, double): will take the meal name and its price then added to the end of the list if the list is full " the list is full " will be printed.
 
printAllMeals(): print all the meals and the prices if the list is not empty else print "the list is empty".
CountAllLessThan(double): will take a price then counts and returns the number of meals which prices are less than the given parameter.
 
riseOfPrices(double): will take a parameter and increase all the meals by this number. If burger’ price is 3.5   and the parameter is (1.2) then the burger price will be 4.7.
 
The destructor: to print "end of class restaurant" statement.
Cheaper (Restaurant &r1, Restaurant  &r2, double price): a non-member function that return the restaurant with more number of cheap meals based on the given price.
 

In the main:

Declare array of objects of type Restaurant rest with size 2.
Prompt the user to enter 4 meals to the rest[0] object and rest[1] using loop structure and cin statement (remember that, each meal has a name and a price).
Print all the meals in the rest[0] object.
Prompt the user to enter a price then prints the number of all meals that have price less than the entered price at rest[0].
Prompt the user to enter a number then increase all meals price at rest[0] by this number. Then print the restaurant object after this action.
Call a cheaper function to know which restaurant is cheaper if the discriminator(المميز) price is 1 JD, Then print the cheaper restaurant object.
 

 Constraints
none

 Input Format
you must enter four meals for each restaurant (i.e. eight string variable and eight double values)

followed by two double values.

 Output Format
see the sample run which is best to explain how the output will be.

 Sample #1
Input
burger 1.25
falafel .75
shawrma 2.20
mojanat 0.25
pizza .75
burger .75
shawrma 2.6
managesh .25
1.5 0.5
Output
meals at the first restaurant:
burger 1.25
falafel 0.75
shawrma 2.2
mojanat 0.25
number of meals less than 1.5 is 3
meals at the first restaurant after raise the price by 0.5:
burger 1.75
falafel 1.25
shawrma 2.7
mojanat 0.75
the cheaper restaurant is
pizza 0.75
burger 0.75
shawrma 2.6
managesh 0.25
end of class restaurant
end of class restaurant
end of class restaurant
